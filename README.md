# Video Integration

- For Local Library, Namida is capable of playing videos related to the music, Video can be found either locally or fetched from youtube

<details>
<summary>

###### How locally?

</summary>
typically looks (inside the folders you specificed) for any matching title, matching goes as following:
<br>
-- Alan walker - Faded.m4a
<br>
-- video alAn WaLkER - faDed (480p).mp4
<br>
the video filename should contain at least one of the following:
 <br>
   1. the music filename as shown above.
 <br>
   2. title & first artist of the track.
<br>
note: some cleanup is made to improve the matching, all symbols & whitespaces are ignored.
</details>

<details>
<summary>

###### How youtube?

</summary>
 â€¢ looks up in the track comment tag (as they are mostly done by @yt-dlp) or filename for any matching youtube link, if found then it starts downloading (and caches) and plays once it's ready, streaming here isn't a good idea as the priority goes for the music file itself.
